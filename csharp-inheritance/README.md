<h1>C# - Inheritance</h1>

<h2>What is Inheritance?</h2>

Inheritance is one of the most important, and most powerful, of the object-oriented programming concepts. Using inheritance, one class can be derived from another. The derived class, also known as the child class or subclass, inherits functionality from the base class, also known as the parent class or superclass. The subclass can add methods and properties or modify the functionality that it has inherited to provide a more specialised version of the base class.

Using inheritance, classes become grouped together in a hierarchical tree structure. The more generalised classes appear at the root of the hierarchy with the more specific classes appearing on the tree's branches. This categorisation of classes into related types is why inheritance is sometimes referred to as generalisation (or generalization).

When using inheritance, all of the base class's methods, properties, events, indexers, operators and some internal variables are all automatically provided to every subclass. As this functionality is automatically available in the child class, there is no need to duplicate code. This reduces maintenance problems, as changes need only to be made in one class, rather than throughout a series of related classes.
