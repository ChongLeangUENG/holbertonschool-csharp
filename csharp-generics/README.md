# C# - Generics

Generic classes and methods

Generic classes and methods combine reusability, type safety, and efficiency in a way that their non-generic counterparts cannot. Generics are most frequently used with collections and the methods that operate on them. The System.Collections.Generic namespace contains several generic-based collection classes. The non-generic collections, such as ArrayList are not recommended and are maintained for compatibility purposes. For more information, see Generics in .NET.
